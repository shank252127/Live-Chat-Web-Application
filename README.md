npm init
npm i express
npm install
npm i socket.io



// Web socket : It does client server connection/two way connection;
                Usually server cannot connect back to the client, so 
                we use websocket.

// Socket.io  : JS library, gives event-based communication, resulting in 
                two way connection.
